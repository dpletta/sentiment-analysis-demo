## 🚀 Production Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Setup

**For Full Production System:**
```bash
# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv hipaa_sentiment_env
source hipaa_sentiment_env/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# or hipaa_sentiment_env\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run setup validation
python setup.py
```

### 2. Data Integration

**Replace synthetic data with your actual feedback:**
```python
import pandas as pd
from hipaa_sentiment_analysis import HIPAACompliantSentimentAnalyzer

# Load your data
df = pd.read_csv('your_feedback_data.csv')

# Required columns:
# - feedback_text: Text to analyze
# - service_type: Service/product category (optional)
# - rating: Numerical rating (optional)
# - date: Feedback date (optional)

# Initialize and run analysis
analyzer = HIPAACompliantSentimentAnalyzer()
analyzer.df = df
analyzer.analyze_sentiment_multiple_approaches()
analyzer.create_comprehensive_visualizations()
```

### 3. Customization Options

**Adjust for your specific needs:**
- **Lexicon Customization**: Add domain-specific sentiment words
- **Service Categories**: Modify to match your product/service types
- **Visualization Themes**: Customize colors and branding
- **Report Templates**: Adapt reporting format to organizational needs
