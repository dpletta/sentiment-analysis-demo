# Color Consistency Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The sentiment breakdown section had inconsistent coloring between the pie chart and description because:
- Colors were hardcoded as `['#2ecc71', '#e74c3c', '#f39c12']` (Green, Red, Orange)
- The order of colors was applied based on the order returned by `value_counts()`
- This meant that if sentiment categories appeared in different orders, they would get different colors

## Solution Implemented
Created a consistent color mapping dictionary that ensures each sentiment category always gets the same color:

```python
sentiment_colors = {'positive': '#2ecc71', 'negative': '#e74c3c', 'neutral': '#f39c12'}
colors = [sentiment_colors[sentiment] for sentiment in sentiment_counts.index]
```

## Files Updated

### 1. hipaa_sentiment_analysis.py

- **Line 429-430**: Updated bar chart color mapping  
- **Line 527-528**: Updated service combination chart colors
- **Line 658-663**: Updated interactive dashboard pie chart colors

### 2. sentiment_analysis_demo.ipynb
- **Cell 10**: Updated pie chart color mapping

## Color Mapping
- **Positive**: Green (#2ecc71)

- **Neutral**: Orange (#f39c12)

## Result
Now all sentiment charts will consistently show:
- Positive sentiment in green
- Negative sentiment in red  
- Neutral sentiment in orange

Regardless of the order in which the sentiment categories appear in the data, the colors will always be consistent across all visualizations.
